   As per our request, you are to develop an “battleships” game that is intended to be played between user
   and computer itself. Also, with the algorithm you create, you’re expected to make the computer play the game
   with reasonable moves rather than random moves. The most important of all, we want you to create a program
   that is built by dividing the game into pieces and building modules and importing the modules.
