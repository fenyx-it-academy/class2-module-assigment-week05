'''Question 1
Write a program which randomly picks an integer from 1 to 100. 
Your program should prompt the user for guesses â€“ if the user guesses incorrectly, 
it should print whether the guess is too high or too low. If the user guesses correctly, 
the program should print how much time the user spend to guess the right answer. 
You can assume that the user will enter valid input.'''
